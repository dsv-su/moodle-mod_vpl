# This file defines the test cases for GIOTES VPL automatic evaluator.
# Each test case is defined by a block starting with 'case = Name_of_Case'.
# Input is provided using 'input =' and expected output using 'output ='.
# For more complex cases or specific requirements, refer to the VPL documentation.
#
# This is an initial stub. Replace this with your actual test cases.

# Example Case (to be removed)
# case = Example Test
# input = 3 5
# output = 8
